I am Vivaan Bajoria from Grade 8 of Step By Step School, Noida. My task was to create a News Website including reports, articles, etc. I will share my website along with this document on Microsoft Teams.
My Websites name is “Good News Only”
2022 was a tough year for many, with the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme weather events, and political turmoil. However, there were moments of hope and joy to be found, and that is what I have included in my website.
I have used languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My website has several different pages like About, Submit a Story and Terms & Conditions. My website has news videos and articles/blogs written about the Good News in 2022. 
In my header I have my website logo, and another way to access the blog page. I have also uploaded a favicon which is my logo. My footer includes a Contact us and a sitemap which makes navigation easier. I have also provided an address and a phone number.
I have used software’s and platforms like Canva, Favicon Generator, Pixabay, Youtube, Google Forms for the backend of the Submit Form.

Further enhancements I would like to do in my website:
Due to time constraints I have added only a few genres of news, I would like in the future to add Business, Finance, Technology etc. I would like to work more on the submit your story part where I can upload the articles of readers who want to submit their story. I would also like to add form validation too.
